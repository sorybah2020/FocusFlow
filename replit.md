# FocusFlow - Productivity and Study App

## Overview

FocusFlow is a comprehensive productivity and study application designed to help students and professionals manage their tasks, focus sessions, notes, and track their progress. The application combines task management, Pomodoro timer functionality, note-taking, and progress tracking in a unified interface. Built as a full-stack web application, it features a React frontend with shadcn/ui components and an Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database integration using Drizzle ORM.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. The application uses Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized builds. Navigation is handled by Wouter, a lightweight client-side router. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable components styled with Tailwind CSS.

State management is handled through TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, eliminating the need for complex global state solutions. The application follows a page-based routing structure with dedicated pages for dashboard, tasks, focus timer, notes, and progress tracking.

### Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js and follows a RESTful API design pattern. The backend implements a modular architecture with separate concerns for routing, storage, and server setup. A storage abstraction layer (IStorage interface) allows for different storage implementations, currently featuring an in-memory storage solution for development and testing.

The API endpoints follow REST conventions with proper HTTP methods and status codes. Middleware is implemented for request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling. The server includes development-specific features like Vite integration for seamless full-stack development.

### Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The schema includes five main entities:

- **Users**: Store user profile information, level progression, focus time tracking, and streak data
- **Tasks**: Manage todo items with priority levels, descriptions, due dates, and completion status
- **Focus Sessions**: Track Pomodoro sessions with duration, type (focus/break), and completion timestamps
- **Notes**: Handle user notes with tagging support and timestamps
- **Habits**: Support habit tracking with completion status and date tracking

All tables use UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL and include proper foreign key relationships and timestamps for audit trails.

### Component Design System
The application uses a comprehensive design system based on shadcn/ui, providing consistent styling and behavior across all interface elements. Components are built with accessibility in mind using Radix UI primitives. The design system includes:

- Consistent color theming with CSS custom properties
- Responsive design patterns for mobile and desktop
- Dark/light mode support infrastructure
- Reusable form components with validation
- Loading states and error handling components

### Development and Deployment Strategy
The application is configured for development with Vite providing fast refresh and development tools. TypeScript is used throughout for type safety and better developer experience. The build process produces optimized static assets for the frontend and a bundled Node.js application for the backend using esbuild.

The development setup includes path mapping for clean imports, middleware for request logging, and development-specific tooling like runtime error overlays. The application is structured to support easy deployment with separate build outputs for client and server code.

## External Dependencies
